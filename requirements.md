### Requirements

To participate, you'll create a video that pitches your idea or concept, shows you've explored how to build it as an Express Add-on, and demonstrates your readiness to bring it to life. We're not looking for polished or finished products.

**We care about three things:  
**1. 🧠 You have a strong idea for an Express Add-on.  
2. ⚙️ You proved the Add-on is technically possible in the Express platform.  
3. 🚀 You're ready and motivated to ship if you win.

##### **REQUIRED**

**🎥 -- Pitch video (~3 minute length - judges will only watch 3 min)  
**_This is your main submission—make it shine._

•  Introduce yourself and your idea for an Add-on. Explain what it is, who it's for, and the problem it solves.  
•  Demonstrate the core features of your idea running in an Express Add-on environment ([local project](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/getting_started/hello-world/#command-line-interface-cli)  or  [Code Playground](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/getting_started/hello-world/#code-playground)) and explain which features support your technical requirements.  
• Briefly tell us your plan to ship the Add-on to production if you win.

##### **OPTIONAL**

• Mockups, sketches, or images  
•  [Private link](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/distribute/private-dist/)  to your Add-on proof of concept  
• Build plans or technical docs  
• User insights, research, or other supporting evidence  
• Anything that proves your concept and commitment to building it  
  
Supporting materials can help you win, but only the pitch video is required.

**Tips for participants**

💅  **Don't stress about polish**  - rough demos, prototypes, or even annotated mockups are fine  _as long as the core idea and compatibility with the Express platform are clear_.  
🚢  **Convince us you'll ship** - show your enthusiasm and intent to build if you win.  
📋❓**Optional materials** (mockups, build plans, etc.) strengthen your project, but your pitch video is most important.
