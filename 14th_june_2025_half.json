      "summary": "The Election Commission's directive for a nationwide Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, similar to the one in Bihar, has drawn criticism from Opposition parties.

The Representation of the People Act, 1950, provides the legal framework for the preparation and revision of electoral rolls. While revisions have been a routine process to update lists and include new voters, challenges like duplicate entries due to internal migration and the accuracy of data have been persistent issues.",

[cite_start]Opposition parties have criticized the EC for the 'hurry' and for not consulting them, with some leaders terming it a potential 'NRC from the backdoor'[cite: 1415, 1464, 1582]. [cite_start]While the Supreme Court declined to halt the process, it suggested that the EC consider additional documents like Aadhaar, voter ID, and ration cards for updating the rolls[cite: 1420].",
        "future": "The final verdict from the Supreme Court will be pivotal in shaping the methodology and future of this nationwide electoral roll revision[cite: 1419, 1557]. The controversy underscores the need for a technologically robust, transparent, and inclusive framework that balances the goal of an error-free electoral roll with the safeguarding of every citizen's fundamental right to vote. [cite_start]The concept of 'One Nation, One Election' is also being discussed as a potential long-term solution to mitigate issues arising from multiple voter registrations across states[cite: 3508]."

It aimed to create a 'One Nation, One Tax, One Market'.
