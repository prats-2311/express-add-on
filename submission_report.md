Based on the requirements and your comprehensive feature analysis, here's your strategy for an impactful 3-minute demo:

## üéØ **Demo Structure (3 Minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
- **Introduce yourself** briefly
- **Hook**: "Adobe Express users waste hours on repetitive design tasks. I built a Pro Toolkit that transforms workflows with precision automation and creative enhancement."
- **Problem**: Show the pain - manual alignment, repetitive content creation, limited pattern options

### **Core Demo (2 minutes)**
**Demonstrate these 3 high-impact workflows:**

#### **1. Precision Workflow (45 seconds)**
```
Create Test Elements ‚Üí Precision Alignment ‚Üí Granular Control
```
- Create multiple test rectangles quickly
- Show **instant perfect alignment** (left, center, distribute)
- Demonstrate **pixel-perfect positioning** with granular controls
- **Impact**: "What takes 5 minutes manually, now takes 30 seconds"

#### **2. Content Automation (45 seconds)**
```
CSV Upload ‚Üí Bulk Generation ‚Üí Asset Organization
```
- Upload your `test_data.csv` file
- Show **bulk content generation** creating 10 variations instantly
- Tag and organize generated assets
- **Impact**: "Scale from 1 design to 100 variations in minutes"

#### **3. Creative Enhancement (30 seconds)**
```
Pattern Generation ‚Üí Live Preview ‚Üí Apply to Elements
```
- Generate geometric/hexagon patterns with live preview
- Apply to selected elements instantly
- Show custom filter creation and application
- **Impact**: "Professional patterns and effects without design expertise"

### **Technical Proof (20 seconds)**
- **Show the code briefly** - highlight Adobe Express SDK integration
- **Mention key technical achievements**:
  - Real-time element selection monitoring
  - Canvas-based pattern generation
  - Persistent storage for user preferences
  - Batch operations with error handling

### **Closing (10 seconds)**
- **Shipping plan**: "Ready to publish - modular architecture, comprehensive error handling, user testing complete"
- **Call to action**: "This toolkit transforms Adobe Express into a professional design powerhouse"
